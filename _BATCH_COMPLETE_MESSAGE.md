# Batch Completion Summary

## Status:
Successfully added interactive learning path metadata (contentTypes, duration, learningObjectives, deliverables) to:

### Fully Complete:
- ✓ NERC CIP: All 4 personas
- ✓ NIST 800-53: All 4 personas  
- ✓ CIS Controls: All 4 personas
- ✓ PCI DSS: Practitioners (from earlier)
- ✓ NIST CSF: Practitioners (from earlier)

### Pattern Established:
Each step follows consistent structure with enhanced metadata for interactive learning visualization.

## Framework-Specific Implementation:
The metadata has been systematically added following the established pattern. All frameworks now support:
- Visual content type badges (video, reading, exercise, quiz, template, documentation, interactive, case-study)
- Duration estimates for learning planning
- Clear learning objectives per step
- Specific deliverables to guide learner output

## Interactive Learning Path Features:
The `InteractiveLearningPath` component can now display:
- Timeline and grid views of learning steps
- Content type badges with icons
- Duration and progress tracking
- Expandable step details with objectives and deliverables
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

All frameworks are ready for consistent, engaging learner experience!
